Brief Summary:

    Our group make a few changes to implement the LRU2 logic. The first thing we did was alter the buf_internals.h header
to include a timestamp field in the BufferDesc struct. This would allow the buffers to have their own timestamp. We also 
declared the global_timestamp here. In the buf_init.c file, we set the timestamps of each buffer to be 0 initially. Next,
we modified code in ReadBuffer_common() to change a buffer's timestamp when it is read. Here we also increment the global_timestamp.
The final thing we did was implement the LRU2 logic in StrategyGetBuffer(). We commented out the old Clock Sweep code and 
added our new logic right below it. 

***IMPORTANT NOTE*** At no point were we able to get the code to print out. Even after a fresh install of PostgreSQL printf
would not print to the server terminal. I'm unsure why this wouldn't work but our group couldn't fix it. The server seemed
to build tables just fine.  

Detailed Changes:
	
1. buf_internals.h: <src/include/storage/buf_internals.h>
	- line 252: added uint32 timestamp to BufferDesc struct
    - line 259: added extern uint32 global_timestamp; 

2. buf_init.c: <src/backend/storage/buffer/buf_init.c>
    - line 129: initialized the timestamp in each buffer to 0

3. bufmgr.c: <src/backend/storage/buffer/bufmgr.c>
    - line 76: uint32 global_timestamp = 0; declaring the global_timestamp from the 

    Function ReadBuffer_common()
    - line 1107 and 1108: updated buffer timestamp and incremented global_timestamp
        bufHdr->timestamp = global_timestamp;
		global_timestamp++;
    - line 1200 and 1201: updated buffer timestamp and incremented global_timestamp
        bufHdr->timestamp = global_timestamp;
		global_timestamp++;

4. freelist.c: <src/backend/storage/buffer/freelist.c>
    StrategyGetBuffer()
    - lines 360 to 425: Implemented LRU2 in this block. Made sure to comment out Clock Sweep directly above it 
    and printed out the buffer array contents before returning the victim buffer.
